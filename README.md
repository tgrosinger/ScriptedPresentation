# ScriptedPresenter

Stop copying and pasting commands during presentations. Use this template.

## Requirements

* tmux 2.3 or greater
* bash
* a terminal
* something to present
* (optional) someone to listen

## How to Use

* Clone this repo
* Modify the examples in `presentation.sh` to suit your needs
* Run `./presentation.sh` from outside tmux
* Press <kbd>enter</kbd> to advance to next command

## How to Contribute

This template isn't perfect, and there are a lot of people that know bash better
than me. If you find a way to accomplish something in this script more
efficiently, easily, or correctly, please send a pull request.
